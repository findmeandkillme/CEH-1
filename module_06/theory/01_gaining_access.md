# Section 01: Gaining Access

## Gaining access
Password cracking
> In cryptanalysis and computer security, password cracking is the process of recovering passwords[1] from data that has been stored in or transmitted by a computer system in scrambled form.

SAM (Security account manager) database
> The Security Account Manager (SAM) is a database file in Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, 8.1, 10 and 11 that stores users' passwords.

NTLM (Net technology lan manager)
> In a Windows network, NT (New Technology) LAN Manager (NTLM) is a suite of Microsoft security protocols intended to provide authentication, integrity, and confidentiality to users.

Kerberos
> Kerberos (/ˈkɜːrbərɒs/) is a computer-network authentication protocol that works on the basis of tickets to allow nodes communicating over a non-secure network to prove their identity to one another in a secure manner.

Dictionary Attack
> In cryptanalysis and computer security, a dictionary attack is an attack using a restricted subset of a keyspace to defeat a cipher or authentication mechanism by trying to determine its decryption key or passphrase, sometimes trying thousands or millions of likely possibilities often obtained from lists of past security breaches.

Brute force attack
> In cryptography, a brute-force attack consists of an attacker submitting many passwords or passphrases with the hope of eventually guessing correctly.

Password spraying attack
> Password spraying is a type of brute force attack.
> In this attack, an attacker will brute force logins based on list of usernames with default passwords on the application.

Hashcat
> Hashcat is a password recovery tool.
> It had a proprietary code base until 2015, but was then released as open source software.

Trojan horse
> In computing, a Trojan horse is any malware that misleads users of its true intent.
> The term is derived from the Ancient Greek story of the deceptive Trojan Horse that led to the fall of the city of Troy.

MiTM (Man in the middle attack)
> In cryptography and computer security, a man-in-the-middle, monster-in-the-middle, machine-in-the-middle, monkey-in-the-middle, meddler-in-the-middle, manipulator-in-the-middle (MITM), person-in-the-middle (PITM) or adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) attack is a cyberattack where the attacker secretly relays and possibly alters the communications between two parties who believe that they are directly communicating with each other, as the attacker has inserted themselves between the two parties.

Rainbow table
> A rainbow table is an efficient way to store data that has been computed in advance to facilitate cracking passwords.
> To protect stored passwords from compromise in case of a data breach, organizations avoid storing them directly, instead transforming them using a scrambling function – typically a cryptographic hash.
 
John the ripper
> John the Ripper is a free password cracking software tool.
> Originally developed for the Unix operating system, it can run on fifteen different platforms.

Password salt
> In cryptography, a salt is random data that is used as an additional input to a one-way function that hashes data, a password or passphrase.

## Exploitation
Exploit DB
> The Exploit Database is an archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software, developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers.

VulDB
> Number one vulnerability management and threat intelligence platform documenting and explaining vulnerabilities since 1970.

Buffer overflow
> In information security and programming, a buffer overflow, or buffer overrun, is an anomaly where a program, while writing data to a buffer, overruns the buffer's boundary and overwrites adjacent memory locations.

Return oriented programming
> Return-oriented programming (ROP) is a computer security exploit technique that allows an attacker to execute code in the presence of security defenses such as executable space protection and code signing.
