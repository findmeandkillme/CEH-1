# Section 01: DoS DDoS Concepts

## Concepts
Denial of service (DoS)
> In computing, a denial-of-service attack (DoS attack) is a cyber-attack in which the perpetrator seeks to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users by temporarily or indefinitely disrupting services of a host connected to a network. Denial of service is typically accomplished by flooding the targeted machine or resource with superfluous requests in an attempt to overload systems and prevent some or all legitimate requests from being fulfilled.

Distributed denial of service
> A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack occurs when multiple systems flood the bandwidth or resources of a targeted system, usually one or more web servers.
> A DDoS attack uses more than one unique IP address or machines, often from thousands of hosts infected with malware.

Botnet
> A botnet is a group of Internet-connected devices, each of which runs one or more bots.
> Botnets can be used to perform Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks, steal data, send spam, and allow the attacker to access the device and its connection.

IRC (Internet relay chat)
> Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is a text-based chat system for instant messaging.
> IRC is designed for group communication in discussion forums, called channels, but also allows one-on-one communication via private messages as well as chat and data transfer, including file sharing.
